# Math Game Bot

A discord bot for a simple math game, written with Discord.py

## Contributing/Executing

Install all dependencies using `poetry install` after cloning the repository. You will need to configure your IDE with the virtual environment it generates, or it may not detect the installed dependencies, or execute the script with `poetry run` directly.

The `MATH_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable must be set with your bot's token, which can be created and found on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/).

Thank you for contributing!
